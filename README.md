## Cześć / Hi / Szia! 👋



Hi! I'm Ilona and this is my little slice of the internet where I explain myself to the world. I do the opposite in my [digital garden](https://ilonaborsos.com/) 🌳

## Core
I think a lot about what it means to me to have a life well lived - and how to craft a life that works _for me_.

## Work
I work as a product manager and I enjoy this career a lot. It's so much fun to be building new things! It's also full of extremely transferrable skills that in my opinion can help everyone to become a more well-rounded person in general.

## Hobbies
I enjoy rollerblading, jigsaw puzzles, photography, the history of Christianity, contemporary art, creative coding. I learn English and Hungarian. I used to be a circus artist as well as travel the world through cheap flights and hitch-hiking, but these days I'm more of a homebody, enjoying calm and cozy days with my sweet husband. 
I maintain a few threads that document these hobbies - I don't update them religiously, but I still enjoy them a lot.
